# MySQL Cluster with Monitoring & Logging on ArvanCloud PaaS

## Introduction & Objective

This document outlines the complete workflow for deploying a **MySQL Master-Slave cluster** with integrated **logging** and **monitoring**, using **ArvanCloud PaaS**, **Helm**, and **Bitnami MySQL charts**. The implementation follows a **three-phase approach**:

1. **Phase 1 â€“ MySQL Cluster Deployment**
    - Provision a Kubernetes-based MySQL primary-secondary cluster using Bitnamiâ€™s Helm chart.
    - Configure replication, security, performance tuning, and expose metrics for monitoring.
2. **Phase 2 â€“ Monitoring Stack Setup**
    - Deploy a Prometheus & Grafana stack with **Ansible**, consuming MySQL metrics via `mysqld-exporter`.
    - Enable centralized performance tracking and visualization.
3. **Phase 3 â€“ Logging Stack Setup (ELK)**
    - Implement an ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized log collection and analysis.
    - Configure index management and optional ILM policies.

The goal is to build a **robust, observable, and maintainable** MySQL infrastructure that supports **real-time monitoring** and **centralized logging**, ensuring high availability, improved troubleshooting, and better performance insights.

# Phase 1 â€“ Set-up MySQL Cluster on PaaS

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Project Description:**  
A MySQL cluster with Master-Slave topology with logging and monitoring on it.  
Requirements â€”> 2 CPU core, 4 GB RAM and 20GB SSD for each instance.  
We are using PaaS from ArvanCloud.

### Major Tasks

- [ ] Set-up kubeconfig on local machine.
- [ ] Add Bitnami repo and pull MySQL Helm chart:  
  ```bash
  helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
